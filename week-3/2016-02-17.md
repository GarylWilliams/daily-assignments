## Daily Homework

#### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should:

* Understand basic jQuery syntax for DOM manipulation

#### Deliverables

* A GitHub repo named `Responsive-Grid`
* Within each folder, `index.html` files and assets folders with a `css` folder and the appropriate files within

* All work turned in via the [Homework Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/a/theironyard.com/forms/d/1kgFQrS4ZIh-h82ruErBGX9lTF3PIomq01kTvT2DZr2A/viewform)

### That Grid Sure is Responsive

Time for a new Blueprint! Tonight focuses on your previous time with HTML and CSS, but with our new responsive skills incorporated.

First, visit the [Responsive Grid](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/04/17/responsive-full-width-grid/) demo. If you download the source, you can get the cat picture they use. Aim for total pixel perfect: the **exact** colors, fonts, sizes, and numbers of boxes in the identical formation.

### Hard/Nightmare Mode
Can you add some JavaScript functionality to this? Brainstorm how you could add some JavaScript to this assignment then **do it**!! The sky's the limit.

Maybe some of those widgets you built on Monday? How can you incorporate them to the existing layout?

Be sure to implement your JavaScript version on another GitHub branch.
