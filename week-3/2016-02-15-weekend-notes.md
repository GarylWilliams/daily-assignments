## 02-15-16 Weekend Assignment Wrap-Up

Some points I noticed across several files:

* Watch out for that `<body>` tag! No body HTML should be above the body tag.

* Assets folders! You should have an `assets` folder, then a `css` and `js` folder within that. Place your `styles.css` in the `css` folder and your `scripts.js` in the `js` folder.

* Is there a better way to solve Multi-Column Form **without** just printing to the console?

* Watch what elements you're grabbing. Print to the console continually to check your work.

* Please include your blog entry in the homework submission form.

* Make sure you're submitting on time. Set an alarm if you need to. Incomplete homework is better than no homework.

* Comment out any wrong code and explain what you were trying to do with it. That is useful for Jasmine and I in guiding your learning, as well as you when you go back these assignments later.

* Don't be afraid to come to Jasmine and I for code reviews!!

We'll look at the weekend homework more tomorrow.
