## Weekly Homework

This week's blog entry will be a little different. You know all the wonderful tutorials you've been finding and using since you started The Iron Yard? Now it's time to give back with your own.

Write one tutorial-style post that explains one **technical** thing you've learned in the past two weeks.

Here are a few ideas:

* How to center an element using CSS
* How to make a card flip using CSS
* How to solve one of our smaller challenges, step-by-step, explaining each step along the way

The sky's the limit! Or at least the past two weeks are...

## Daily Homework

### JavaScript Widgets

#### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should:

* Understand basic jQuery syntax for DOM manipulation
* Understand some common UI patterns and how to build them
* **DO NOT USE ANY PRE-BUILT JQUERY PLUGINS**

#### Deliverables

* A GitHub repo named `jquery-widgets`
* Within that repo, folders for each widget
* Within each folder, `index.html` files and assets folders with `css` and `js` folders and the appropriate files within

* All work turned in via the [Homework Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/a/theironyard.com/forms/d/1kgFQrS4ZIh-h82ruErBGX9lTF3PIomq01kTvT2DZr2A/viewform)

### Modal
* Create an HTML page with a button on it.
* When you click the button, show a modal using jQuery.
* When you click the greyed out background, hide the modal.
* When you click the [X] close button, hide the modal.
* Make sure it's *styled* with CSS, too: add a font-stack of your choice and choose appropriate font and background colors.

### Textarea With Max-length

* Write JavaScript which finds any textareas that have a max-size attribute:
  (e.g. `<textarea maxsize="25"></textarea>`).
* Write JavaScript to prevent the user from entering more than maxsize chars.
* As the user types, show them how many characters they have remaining.
* Style the page with CSS: add a font-stack of your choice and choose appropriate font and background colors.

### Dynamic list

* Create a site with a textbox.
* When the user enters text into it, add another beneath it.
* When the user removes all text from a textbox, and the textbox loses focus, delete the textbox.
* There should always be at least one textbox.
* Style the page with CSS: add a font-stack of your choice and choose appropriate font and background colors.

### Hard Mode

#### Drag 'n Drop
* Use mouse events to allow a user to reorder items in a list.
* The user should be able to drag an item up or down.
* Style the page with CSS: add a font-stack of your choice and choose appropriate font and background colors.

### Nightmare Mode

#### Date Picker
* Create a date picker without using a jQuery plug-in.
