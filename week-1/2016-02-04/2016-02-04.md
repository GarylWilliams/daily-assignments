### Memory Game

#### Description

Did you ever play Memory? The goal is to find all matching tiles. We'll actually implement this game later in the cohort. But for now, we're just going to lay the game board out.

Here's the final project (working with JavaScript, so don't worry about that. This is just for a point of reference): [Memory](http://chrisdavies.github.io/memory/)

#### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand positioning
* Understand custom form element styling
* Understand how to maintain a grid's aspect ratio

#### Resources

This uses animations (if you do the stretch-goals), so here are some handy tools around animations:

* [Hover](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
* [Animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
* [CSS Animation CheatSheet](http://www.justinaguilar.com/animations/index.html)

And here is the [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/) article about it.

#### Deliverables

* A GitHub project called "memory-layout"
* An index page that looks like the one shown here:
![here](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-2015/curriculum/raw/master/img/memory-gameboard.gif)
* When you click a tile, it should flip
* When you click it again, it should flip back
* A link to your assignment repo in the [Homework Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kgFQrS4ZIh-h82ruErBGX9lTF3PIomq01kTvT2DZr2A/viewform)

### Normal Mode (MVP)

* Get the page to display as shown in the image
* In the title, display a lightbulb instead of the o in the word "Memory"
* Use a web-font for the header
  * The Google font in the demo is [Orbitron](http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Orbitron)
* Use an icon font for the tiles (and for the lightbulb in the header)
  * There should be at least 16 icons in it
  * The demo was built using: [Fontastic](http://fontastic.me/) but you can use [FontAwesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) just as easily.
* Display lives remaining as a band of hearts
* Just hard-code the time into your HTML:

    <span class="game__time">2:10</span>

* Add a "new-game.html" page which displays something like this:

![new game](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-2015/curriculum/raw/master/img/memory-new-game.gif)

* Note the animated background colors and foreground positioning
  * [This](http://www.justinaguilar.com/animations/index.html) was used to help get the animations started, but animations are a stretch-goal
* Note the hover effects on the buttons
* When you click easy or hard, it should take you to the game board screen

### Hard Mode

* Add animations
* Add background music
