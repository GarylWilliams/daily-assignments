### Normal Mode

Navigate to the [Vertical Timeline](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/05/02/vertical-timeline/) demo site. Check it out in the Elements Inspector. Hover over elements, change colors, move text -- play around and have fun.

Now it's time to get coding. Create your `index.html` and `styles.css` and link them. Commit your new file and start a GitHub repo named `vertical-timeline`.

In your `index.html` and `styles.css` file, start building the site as close to the original as you can. Be sure to spend ample time on the layout, as that's where the real challenge lies.

Also pay careful attention to the subtle decorative challenges you need to work with: the caret on the text block, the icons hanging out over the vertical line, the vertical line itself. You'll need to learn about `::before` and it's twin `::after` to implement those properly. You should also note that several of these boxes seem to be missing their corners... the icons are totally enclosed in circles, even! How do you make a box look like a circle?
