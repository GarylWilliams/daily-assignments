## HTML/CSS/Git Intro - The Iron News

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills in being a professional web developer is the translation of a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. One of the basic, foundational news portals for professional web developers is "Hacker News," which is kind of like a Reddit for the startup/design/development community with a very... *minimalist* design ethic.

Since it's so simple (there's only one image!) we're going to start off here.

At the same time, we're also going to get into the habit of frequently creating git commits as checkpoints.

### Objectives

##### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be comfortable with

* Translating images/PSDs to HTML and CSS
* Using git on the command line
* Best practices for committing frequently

##### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* Git and GitHub
* Terminal
* Your text editor of choice

#### Deliverables

* A link to your assignment repo in the [Homework Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/a/theironyard.com/forms/d/1kgFQrS4ZIh-h82ruErBGX9lTF3PIomq01kTvT2DZr2A/viewform).

### Details

##### Deliverables

* A GitHub repo containing
    * `index.html`
    * `index.css`
    * All images in an `assets/images` folder

##### Requirements

* Valid, semantic HTML
* Valid CSS
* At least one git commit (with a message) every hour that you're working on this project

### Normal Mode

Using HTML and CSS, re-create the included image (`Iron News.png`) as a webpage. Don't worry about the text content (feel free to use an ipsum generator), but use the original image and *make your best effort* to match the dimensions and styles of original page to yours.
