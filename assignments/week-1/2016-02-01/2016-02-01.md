### Reading HTML: Block vs Inline

This week is all about writing HTML, so you'll need to use [the HTML section of MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) to research and document the tags you'll meet this week in `CheatSheets/HTML.md`. So you don't leave out any important details, use the **Starting Point** provided below by copying and pasting it into an Atom file titled `reading-html.md`. Be sure to identify which [content category](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Flow_content) each element belongs to, the types of permissible content and parents, and document any important attributes. It would also be good to know how these relate to some key CSS properties... like what's included in the **Starting Point**.

You MUST include the following tags in your documentation, and 10 tags in all for tonight:

* `<!DOCTYPE>`
* `<!-- -->`
* `<html>`
* `<head>`
* `<body>`

To start, explain the basic structure of a tag. Include a dissection of the non-word characters used (like brackets, etc), the words inside the brackets, why some tags have other tags in them and how to write them with and without contents. There's a handy pool of examples in [the HTML5 Boilerplate project](http://html5boilerplate.com), so dissect the tags used in `index.html` and `404.html`. For some help with some of the weirdo ones, check out [Conditional Comments on Wikipedia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_comment).

_There are three attributes that apply universally to all tags._ As you identify them, move them into their own section at the top of your document, as in the **Starting Point**

#### HARD MODE

Include _all_ the list-describing elements such as `<li>`, `<dt>` and their appropriate siblings and parents. There are only about 6 of them, if you don't count the _experimental_ tags like `<menu>`.

#### NIGHTMARE MODE

Include _all_ [the Interactive Form elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Forms), like `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>` and the rest, noting the differences between `type` attribute values; don't omit `<fieldgroup>` or `<legend>`... They'll come up.

#### Starting Point

```markdown
## `<html>`

the main enchilada, the whole `document`, that which wraps all the others... except for [`<!DOCTYPE>`](#doctype), for some reason.

* _parents_: none, it's the top
* _content_: _only_ [`<head>`](#head) and [`<body>`](#body)
* _display_: `block`, maybe? I mean, I can see it... RESEARCH!

### Attributes

* `class` -- a space-separated list of category names
* . . .

. . .

## `<div>`

A generic page division that should only be used if no other, more semantic choice is appropriate.

* _parents_: anything that accepts [Flow Content][1], which is apparently a lot of things.
* _content_: any [Flow Contant][1], palpable content (WTF?)
* _display_: `block`

. . .

### Journal, Week One: The Right Mindset

Create a new repository called `USERNAME.github.io` where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username, e.g. https://github.com/kellymurray/kellymurray.github.io/. Select the CC0 license and elect to create a `README` file for the repository. Create a page in the wiki for your repo called `The Right Mindset`.

Research _The Growth Mindsets_ by Dr. Carol Dweck, starting with the videos provided below. Document your sources on your wiki page, targeting a short journal entry that includes _all_ of the following:

1. summarizes the two mindsets and characteristics of each
1. **either** describes a personal situation in which you experienced each mindset **or** describes which aspects of each mindset you recognize in yourself
1. explains how you will apply this understanding to your experience at The Iron Yard

If you need guidance, follow [the writing process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_process): start by brainstorming some ideas about the topic and write an outline of your essay, no more than three levels deep, on your wiki page. Otherwise, you can start with your first Rough Draft -- very unorganized, stream of consciousness.

This assignment will be due next Thursday. _Be sure to link your wiki page on the Homework Submission form!_

#### Videos for _The Growth Mindset_

* [_You can learn anything_ on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/youcanlearnanything)
* [_The Power of Yet_ by Dr. Carol Dweck on TED](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve)
* [_Carol Dweck, Growth Mindsets and Motivation_ on TED-ed](http://ed.ted.com/on/UA77FlTc)

## Daily Homework

### CodePen

##### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Understand the building blocks of web development
* Be comfortable with the general requirements for submitting assignments :)

##### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* HTML
* CSS
* CodePen

### Details

#### Deliverables

* Links to your CodePen(s) in the [Homework Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kgFQrS4ZIh-h82ruErBGX9lTF3PIomq01kTvT2DZr2A/viewform?usp=send_form)

### Tag It!

Create a CodePen that contains at least **10** distinct HTML tags, and **10** different CSS properties.

Your HTML should be valid, semantic, and go at least four levels deep.

Your CSS should be valid and use at least three complex selectors.

### That Doesn't Look Right...

After getting those tags down, take a look at [this CodePen](http://codepen.io/kellymurray/pen/VexmqP). There's a few rendering bugs in this pen and it's your job to fix them!

Make a fork of the CodePen (just hit the "Fork" button on the top) and correct the HTML bugs.

### Evening Listening

Tonight, please listen to this lecture [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY14Er6JX2s](about giving and getting technical help) by Sasha Laundy. We'll be discussing it in class tomorrow!

### And finally...

If you haven't finished your pre-work yet -- finish it!
