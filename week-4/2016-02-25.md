## The app

This weekend, you're going to build a single-page mobile application which manages
appointments *and* shows the weather (temperature and sunny/cloudy/rainy/snowy)
for the time and place of the appointment.

Your company's designer has provided the following mock-ups. You want to get as close to the mock-up as possible.

![Appointments App](https://github.com/tiyd-fee-2016-02/daily-assignments/blob/spoof/week-4/app-mockup.jpg)

## Normal Mode

* add appointment
  - title
  - street, city, state
  - date, time
* list appointments
* view appointment details full-screen (appointment detail)
  - in full-screen display, an appointment should show the weather
  - city, state, date and time should be taken into account when showing weather
* edit appointment
* delete appointment
  - styled confirmation prompt ('Are you sure you want to delete?' [Delete | Cancel])
* hide appointments that are more than 1 hr past
* persist appointments in local storage
* load appointments from local storage when app first loads
* clear past appointments (older than 7 days) out of local storage

## Hard mode

* detect a non-mobile browser, and show a "use this on mobile" screen
* show weather for place/time in list screen
* date/time picker
  - http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/
  - ... or find another or roll your own
* search bar on list screen which filters appointments as you type
* Modify list view items based on whether they occur today, this week, or
further into the future
  - If the appointment is today, display only the time
    - e.g. 5:00 pm - Talk to Brad
  - If the appointment is this week, but not today:
    - Display: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, or Sun
    - e.g. Tue 5:00 pm - Talk to Brad
  - If the appointment is more than a week away:
    - Display: date and time
    - e.g. 2/23/15 5:00 pm - Talk to Brad

## Nightmare mode

* get current location from the (Geo Location API)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation]
* export to [iCal format](https://github.com/nwcell/ics.js)
* ability to auto-fill city/state in by geolocation
* Show a small map (from Google, Bing, or elsewhere) for the appointment locale
* play a sound when an appointment is coming up
