Elect a single Team Lead for tonight. Formulate a group plan of attack for building out _at least one feature per person_ with HTML, (S)CSS, and some AngularJS, but with one catch: **the Team Lead cannot write / commit any code.** His or her job is to pair up with each of the other two, lead code reviews, and ensure the submitted work matches the joint plan.

The Team Lead role will rotate _every night_. Each night you _must document who was the team lead for that night_ on a `.md` file. If that's you this time around, don't waste your time waiting around for code to review: refine the plan, pro-actively pair up with your teammates, help with research, etc. Make the most of your time to maximize _their_ productivity.

_Do Not Push to Master_. Create your own branches dependent on the features you're working on, as well as a final branch per team that you will all merge into. You will need to do regular `git pulls` to keep up-to-date. Then we will work to merge the site together on Monday.

On the `README.md`, note what teams are working on what pages and further break down the features that each section will need.
