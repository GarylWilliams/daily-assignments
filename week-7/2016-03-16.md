## Daily Assignment

### Deliverables

* GitHub repo forked from [javascript-koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans)
* New branch _in your forks_ called `solutions`
* Your completed `.js` files
* A branch on your Appointments repo with your new routing app

## The Other Jasmine

Tonight, you'll be learning JavaScript...through the lens of testing. Make a fork of [javascript-koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans) and then clone your fork to your computer.

Now, in Chrome, open up the `KoansRunner.html` page. To make the tests pass, you'll need to edit the accompanying `.js` files in the correct ways. Good luck!

You do _not_ need to do `AboutApplyingWhatWeHaveLearnt.js`.

## You Have an Appointment...with the Appointments App!

Remember the appointment app? Time to revisit it! But just a little.

Tonight, pair with your previous partner and set up the routing for your app. This involves:

* Breaking up the HTML into partials
* Creating a `main.html` page to load the partials into
* Re-organizing links
* Set up the routing

You don't need to achieve functionality...unless you want to. Consider that **Nightmare Mode**.
