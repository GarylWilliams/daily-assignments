### Shaping Up with AngularJS

Tonight, go through the entirety of the [Shaping Up With Angualar.JS](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/) course. It's a Free course, but you will need to create a Free Account if you haven't already. Don't pay for it (unless you feel so inclined).

Try to solve the quizzes for yourself, but don't be afraid to "buy" the answers if you're stuck on a question for more than five minutes. (this is free)
