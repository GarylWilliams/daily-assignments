You've been pretty busy with TIY, so you probably haven't gone shopping in a while. Well...that isn't changing. But, in this assignment, you'll make your very own shopping experience (think Amazon, Society6, etc.) using our new friend AngularJS. How useful the CodeSchool course you've completed is all about building a store...
