You made it to week 9! Congratulations! I'm so proud of you all.

This week, you have two tasks:

1. Work on your portfolio
2. And perfect your pitch (if you're pitching)

## Portfolio

Get started on that portfolio! It should be responsive, showcase past work, and include your contact information in an easy-to-find location above the fold. Jasmine and I will be on campus all week to help you, and every day that our class meets for Homework Share we expect to see _something_ from you. So get working!

## Perfect Your Pitch

If you're pitching on Friday, now is the time to perfect your pitch. Short, meaningful keynotes are always useful in illustrating your project idea. Remember, you only have a couple minutes to pitch, so you want to use your time wisely.

Be sure to address the following:

1. How your project solves a problem

2. What user group you can rely on to test the project

3. What basic technologies you plan to use

4. What you think would be a good team structure (2 front-end, 2 rails, for instance)

Again, Jasmine and I will be on campus all week to chat about your pitch ideas. On Thursday we'll also have a special pitch/final project wrap-up lecture.

Go Team Front-End!
