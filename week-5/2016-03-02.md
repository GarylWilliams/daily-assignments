## Daily Homework

You have two homework options tonight.

### Option 1: Bootstrap + APIs

Build a simple website using Bootstrap that also utilizes two APIs of your choice.

Check out [The Programmable Web](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) for APIs. And a nifty [Dictionary API](https://glosbe.com/a-api) to translate single words from one language to another.

The sky's the limit on this one -- just build something _cool_!

### Option 2: Deja Vu

Work on two old projects. Refactor the code, clean them up, finish them, use Sass -- whatever it takes to make those projects better. Be prepared to show us in class tomorrow.
