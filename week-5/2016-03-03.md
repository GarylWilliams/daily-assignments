## Weekend Homework

For this assignment, you have the option of working with someone else or by yourself. However, you have to *choose* your own partner.

### Deliverables

* A new GitHub repo named `TIY-Chessboard`
* Appropriate `.html`, `.css` and `.js` files in the correct locations
* Turned in via the [Homework Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kgFQrS4ZIh-h82ruErBGX9lTF3PIomq01kTvT2DZr2A/viewform?usp=send_form)

### Learning Objectives

* Reviewing HTMl, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery
* 2D Arrays
* Game logic

### Shall we play a game?

You'll be building a chessboard application this weekend. It should be wired to walk through the steps of the [Catalan Opening: Closed Variation](https://www.chess.com/opening/eco/E06_Catalan_Opening_Closed_Variation). This should be your reference implementation.

Start by creating a _new_ repo in Github called `TIY-Chessboard`. Be sure to read [the double-indexed `Array` example from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Creating_a_two-dimensional_array).

Build an 8-by-8 grid of squares (equal height and width) using semantic HTML and some CSS. It can look like the [Chess.com](http://www.chess.com) interface. Include markers for rank ("8" through "1") and file ("a" through "h") above, below and on each side of the grid. The squares on the grid should alternate colors between dark and light colors, your discretion, but the upper-left and bottom-right squares should be light.

Create a bank of buttons beneath the grid that include "rewind", "step back", "play / pause", "step forward", and "fast forward" buttons, as on the reference implementation. Get as fancy as you want to with colors, button styles, and icons (which can be taken from Font Awesome!).

Now...make it work! The user should be able to click through the buttons and see each move, step-by-step.

MVP is getting "step forward" and "step back" working.

Second release is "rewind" and "fast forward".

#### BEAST MODE

The "play/pause" button.

#### NIGHTMARE MODE

Last chance to work on those old projects (for now). Clean them up, refactor them, finish them, push them live to `gh-pages`.

#### APOCALYPSE MODE

Skynet.
