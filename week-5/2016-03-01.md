## Daily Homework

### Normal Mode

Tonight, you're building a new BluePrint _and_ using your new tools Bower and Sass to do it.

First, read through the ["Setting Up Your Project"](http://weaintplastic.github.io/web-development-field-guide/Development/Frontend_Development/index.html) chapter of the Web Development Field Guide. Come to class with questions tomorrow!

Now, head to [Responsive Icon Grid](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/07/01/responsive-icon-grid/). Ooh, check out that responsiveness.

For this project you'll:

* Build this site
* But _replace_ the text and icons with your own choices
* And utilize `bower install` and Sass to build
* A bower.json file

Your finished project should be in a repo called `responsive-icon-grid`.

Don't forget to _ignore_ your bower dependencies in your `.git` file!

### Hard Mode

Got an old project you want to finish? Or make better? Tonight's your night. Work on an old project and be prepared to show us some of the changes tomorrow.
